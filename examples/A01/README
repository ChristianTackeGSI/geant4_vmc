Example A01
-----------
  Geant4 extended example analysis/A01 adapted to Virtual Monte Carlo.

  Demonstrates:
    Geometry - placements with rotations, divided volume
    Geometry - local magnetic field (G4 only)
    Geometry defined via Geant4 (G4) or Root file
    Definition of sensitive volumes
    Hodoscope, drift chamber and calorimeter detector types
    Particles cuts 
      - G4 cut in range: 1mm
        G3 cuts set to correspond to 1mm cut in range
    Primary generator with fixed position and momentum, optionally
        randomized momentum within a given interval
    Storing hits, particles stack (from E03 exaample) in Root file

    geant4/examples/extednded/analysis/A01/README

Macros:
-------

  For running example with G3:
  
  load_g3.C       - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant3
  run_g3.C        - macro for running example
  g3tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro for G3 with TGeo geometry(default)

  For running example with G4:
  
  load_g4.C       - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant
  run_g4.C        - macro for running example
  g4Config.C      - configuration macro - geometry option geomRootToGeant4 (default)
  g4Config1.C     - configuration macro - geometry defined via Geant4 (geomGeant4)
  g4Config2.C     - configuration macro - geometry option geomRootToGeant4 with local magnetic field
  g4tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro - G4 with TGeo navigation 
  g4tgeoConfig2.C - configuration macro - G4 with TGeo navigation with local magnetic field
  g4config.in   - macro for G4 configuration using G4 commands (called from g4Config.C)
  g4config2.in  - macro for G4 configuration using G4 commands (called from g4tgeoConfig2.C)
  g4vis.in      - macro for G4 visualization settings (called from set_vis.C) 

  Common macro (called by run_g3.C/run_g4.C):
  
  set_vis.C - setting visualization

To run example 
---------------
  
  With G3 + TGeo:
  root[0] .x load_g3.C
  root[1] .x run_g3.C

  With G4:
  root[0] .x load_g4.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C

  With G4 + TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x load_g4.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig.C");

  With G4 with geometry defined via Geant4:
  root[0] .x load_g4.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4Config1.C");

  Note that as geometry is defined via TGeo or native Geant4,
  the example cannot be run with TGeant3 with its native geometry.
