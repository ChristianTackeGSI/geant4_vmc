  Copyright Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics
  (INFN) and European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
  ("the FLUKA copyright holders"), 1989-2007.
    
  All rights not expressly granted under this license are
  reserved.
    
  This software results from work performed by Alberto Fasso`,
  Alfredo Ferrari, Johannes Ranft and Paola Sala.
    
  INFN and CERN are the exclusive source of distribution of
  the code, bug fixes and documentation of the FLUKA
  software. Each official version of FLUKA is identified by a
  numbering scheme specifying major and minor releases.
    
  The FLUKA Coordination Committee or its delegates are able
  to grant any of the permissions noted in this License
  Agreement as requiring a specific consent. Any such consent
  may only be granted in writing.
    
  Installation, use, reproduction, display of the FLUKA
  software ("FLUKA"), in source and binary forms, are
  permitted free of charge on a non-exclusive basis for
  internal scientific, non-commercial and non-weapon-related
  use by non-profit organizations only. Any exercise of these
  rights is subject to the following conditions:
    
  1 Insertion of the FLUKA code, in whole or in part, into
    other codes, or its translation into any other computer
    language are possible only after obtaining prior written
    permission. Modifications of the FLUKA code are permitted
    for use by the licensee only, unless authorized in
    written.
    
  2 FLUKA is non-transferable, non-sub-licensable and may not
    be distributed in any way, without express written
    consent, whether in original or modified form. Site-wise
    or collaboration-wise conditions can be agreed with the
    FLUKA Coordination Committee.
    
  3 Notwithstanding the above, the licensee may modify and
    sub-license FLUKA User Routines to third parties in so far
    as their purpose is limited to the adaptation of input and
    output interfaces of FLUKA and their modification does not
    circumvent, replace, add to or modify any of the functions
    of FLUKA, or extract specific isolated results from any of
    the individual internal physics models embedded within
    FLUKA.
    
  4 The licensee shall forthwith license all its modifications
    of FLUKA to the FLUKA copyright holders, at no cost and
    with no limitation of use. The licensee acknowledges that
    the FLUKA copyright holders may insert such modifications
    into future releases of FLUKA, subject to appropriate
    acknowledgment of the licensee's contribution.
    
  5 Any publication by the licensee with respect to FLUKA or
    results obtained from it shall explicitly acknowledge
    FLUKA by quoting its set of references and the FLUKA
    copyright holders. The licensee shall not without prior
    written permission publish documents or results based on a
    modified form of FLUKA, unless the modification
    exclusively concerns User Routines for the adaptation of
    its input and output interfaces which comply with the same
    restrictions, as defined in section 3) as those which
    apply to sub-licensing. Any publication of documents or
    results shall be based only on official FLUKA versions as
    obtained from the FLUKA website (http://www.fluka.org) or
    from any authorized mirror. Publication here implies any
    legal publication to any third party, whether verbal,
    electronic, visual, in writing or otherwise.
    
  6 The licensee shall ensure that the FLUKA references,
    copyright statement and license conditions are not altered
    or removed from FLUKA. Any integration of any portion of
    FLUKA, in modified or in unmodified form, into any other
    software package must preserve the internal copyright
    notices in those portions of FLUKA that have been
    employed, and must reproduce such notices within any
    additional global notices included along or embedded
    within the software into which FLUKA has been
    integrated. Any portion of FLUKA so integrated, whether
    modified or unmodified shall continue to be subject to
    these license conditions.
    
  7 Nothing in this license shall be construed as to grant any
    rights in any of the FLUKA versions since 1989. In
    addition, users are not permitted to circumvent any
    protection in prior distributions of FLUKA that provided
    for a preset expiration date of the code
    
  8 Versions or parts of the FLUKA source code, entrusted to
    individuals or groups prior to the enactment of the
    CERN-INFN Collaboration Agreement, which are listed in
    Chapter 5 of Annex 1 of the EP-AB-INFN Scientific
    Agreement (19-02-2003), together with the agreed
    conditions of use, are subject to this License Agreement
    in addition to any other restrictions on the scope of use
    that may have been part of the initial use grant.
    
  9 Commercial use of FLUKA, outside the scope of this
    license, must be negotiated with the copyright holders

  REQUESTS MADE BY THE FLUKA AUTHORS TO ALL USERS
    
  All licensees are requested to report as soon as practical
  to the Authors any errors or bugs found in any portion of
  FLUKA and its accompanying documentation.
    
  All licensees are requested to forward copies of all
  comparisons that they may make between FLUKA results and
  data or other codes as soon as practical.  The Authors agree
  to keep any such communications confidential unless
  otherwise notified by the contributing user.
    
  The Authors reserve the right of publishing any benchmarking
  and/or comparisons of the distinct separate performance of
  the individual internal models that are embedded into FLUKA,
  whether the comparisons are with data or with other
  codes. The Authors would also like to convey a general
  willingness to conduct any such benchmarking efforts either
  upon request or in collaboration with interested parties. In
  case of doubt please contact the Authors.
    
  Users should exclusively download FLUKA from the official
  FLUKA website (http://www.fluka.org) or one of the
  authorized mirror sites.  Users are invited to regularly
  update their FLUKA version to profit for improvements and
  bug fixes.
    
  Users are invited to use reasonably updated versions of the
  code for publications. Publications of results based on
  those FLUKA versions that are declared unsupported and
  obsolete on the official FLUKA website shall be avoided.
    
  Users should address any request of consent to one member of
  the FLUKA Coordinating Committee, which at present is
  composed as follows:
