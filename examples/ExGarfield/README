ExGarfield example
===================
  Garfield garfieldgpp example adapted to Virtual Monte Carlo.

  It demonstrates:
    Integration of Garfield simulation model in Geant4 VMC simulation;
    Garfield model in not used when running the example with Geant3.

  See also the original Garfield example description at:
    http://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/examples/geant4-interface/

Compilation:
============
  The example requires Garfield installation;
  the following CMake options have to be added in the CMake configuration:

  -DGarfield_DIR=path_to_garfield_installation
  -DGarfield_INC_DIR=path_to_garfield_source/Include


Macros:
=======

  For running example with G4:
  
  load_g4.C       - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant
  run_g4.C        - macro for running example
  g4Config.C      - configuration macro - G4 native geometry navigation (default)
  g4tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro - G4 with TGeo navigation 
  g4config.in     - macro for G4 configuration using G4 commands (called from g4Config.C)
  g4config2.in    - macro for setting after initialization
  g4vis.in        - macro for G4 visualization settings (called from set_vis.C) 

  Common macro (called by run_g3.C/run_g4.C):
  
  set_vis.C - setting visualization

  For running example with G3:
  (Note that Garfield is not used with Geant3 simulation.)

  load_g3.C       - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant3
  run_g3.C        - macro for running example
  g3tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro for G3 with TGeo geometry


To run example 
===============
  The environment variable HEED_DATABASE pointing to /garfield/Heed/heed++/database
  directory has to be set.
  
  With G4:
  root[0] .x load_g4.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C

  With G4 + TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x load_g4.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig.C");

  With G3 + TGeo:
  (Note that Garfield is not used with Geant3 simulation)
  root[0] .x load_g3.C
  root[1] .x run_g3.C
