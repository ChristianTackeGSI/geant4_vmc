===============
  29/03/2005
  v1-6:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Added possibility to use VGM for geometry conversion and
        export to XML as an alternative to geant4_vmc/convertors;
        use of VGM is optional, handled by the environment variable USE_VGM.
        If USE_VGM is set, the VGM is used for all geometry conversions
        by default, old roottog4 convertor can be selected via command:
        /mcDet/useVGM false
        old g4toxml convertor is disabled.
      - Fixed setting cuts and G3 controls via special cuts and
        special control processes.
      
    Tested with Geant4 7.0, Root 4.03/02, VGM 2.03

  v1-5:
    Geant4 VMC:
      Migration to Geant4 version 7.0;
      correction in passing step limits defined in tracking media
      to Geant4.
      Doxygen documentation.

    Examples:
      Added test_suite.sh to test automatically all examples with
      all MCs; added configuration macros for TGeant3TGeo.
      
    Tested with Geant4 7.0, Root 4.02/00
 

  05/10/2004
  v1-4:
    Geant4_vmc:
      Updated for modifications in TVirtualMC;
      corrections in Gmtod(), Gdtom() functions 

    Convertors
    g4toxml:
      AGDD convertor now generates full AGDD document,
      the TOP.xml file is not needed anymore.
    roottog4:
      Added support for composite shapes;
      Added support for divisions in reflected mothers; 
      Corrections in mapping tracking media Ids to G4 logical volumes
    
    Platform names have been changed according to root-config --arch;
    this changes also the target lib and tmp directories names.
    Tested with Geant4 6.2, Root 4.01/02


  26/04/2004
  v1-3:
    Convertors:
    g4toxml:
      Design updated to support two XML format: AGDD and GDML (new);
      the command for XML file generation changed to 
        /xml/generateAGDD [volName]
        /xml/generateGDML [volName] 

    roottog4:
       Bug fixes in sphere (rmax); polycone and polyhedra solids
       (do not modify original parameters of TGeo shapes).
    
    Tested with Geant4 6.1, Root 3.10/02 and Root 4.00/03.

    
  18/12/2003:
  v1-2:
    Geant4_vmc:
    Update to Geant4 6.0 (removal of g4std, G4std);
    updated physics contructors according to novice examples in
    Geant4 6.0. 

    Convertors - g4toxml:
    Corrected export of reflected volumes. 

    Tested with Geant4 6.0, Root 3.10/01.
    

  10/10/2003:
  v1-1:
    Geant4_vmc:
    Implemented new functions from TVirtualMC
    enabling user to define own particles and ions
    + getter functions:
    DefineParticle(..)
    DefineIon(..)
    ParticleName(..) const
    ParticleMass(..) const	  
    Double_t  ParticleCharge(..) const
    Double_t  ParticleLifeTime(..) const
    TMCParticleType ParticleMCType(..) const

    Examples:
    Update to changes in VMC:
    removed functions TrackingRmax, TrackingZmax (not needed if default is used);
    removed calls to gMC->DefineParticles() in InitMC 
    (this function is going to be removed from TVirtualMC).  
   
    Tested with Geant4 5.2, Root 3.10/01.

  21/07/2003:
  v1-0:
    Convertors:
    Added new directory with geometry convertors:
    - roottog4 - convertor from Root to G4 (still in development);
    - g4toxml - convertor from G4 to XML (AGDD) - separated from
                geant4_vmc

    Geant4_vmc:
    Updated for changes in TVirtualMCStack;
    modifications to support geometry defined via TGeo
    using roottog4 convertor.
    
    Examples:
    In E01 added new functions for building geometry via TGeo
    as an alternative to old way via VMC;
    update for changes in TVirtualStack.  
    
    Tested with Geant4 5.2, Root 3.05/06.

  03/06/2003:
  v0-5:
    geant4_vmc:
    Enabled a user defined physics list:
    TG4VRunConfiguration can be overriden by a user own
    class instantiating a user own physics list
    (derived from G4VUserPhysicsList). 
    Update for Geant4 5.1.

    Examples:
    Corrected deleting of MC application
    (to avoid warning from deleting static G4 objects when exiting Root)
    
    Tested with Geant4 5.1, Root 3.05/04.

  13/03/2003:
  v0-4:
    geant4_vmc:
    Saving secondary particles to MC stack made optional
    (added /mcTracking/saveSecondaries command); 
    a few corrections.
    
    Examples:
    New example E03;    
    Corrected implementation in the examples stack classes
    - fixed meaning of the argument done (renamed toBeDone)
    to be consistent with TGeant3 implementation;

    Tested with Geant4 5.0, Root 3.05/03.

  29/01/2003:
  v0-3:
    Update to changes in TVirtualMC;
    the XML convertor classes made independent from Geant4 VMC.

    Update for new Geant4 version; 
    a few corrections (mainly in makefiles).
    Tested with Geant4 5.0, Root 3.04/01.

  12/10/2002:
