===============
  26/04/2004
  v1-3:
    Convertors:
    g4toxml:
      Design updated to support two XML format: AGDD and GDML (new);
      the command for XML file generation changed to 
        /xml/generateAGDD [volName]
        /xml/generateGDML [volName] 

    roottog4:
       Bug fixes in sphere (rmax); polycone and polyhedra solids
       (do not modify original parameters of TGeo shapes).
    
    Tested with Geant4 6.1, Root 3.10/02 and Root 4.00/03.

    
  18/12/2003:
  v1-2:
    Geant4_vmc:
    Update to Geant4 6.0 (removal of g4std, G4std);
    updated physics contructors according to novice examples in
    Geant4 6.0. 

    Convertors - g4toxml:
    Corrected export of reflected volumes. 

    Tested with Geant4 6.0, Root 3.10/01.
    

  10/10/2003:
  v1-1:
    Geant4_vmc:
    Implemented new functions from TVirtualMC
    enabling user to define own particles and ions
    + getter functions:
    DefineParticle(..)
    DefineIon(..)
    ParticleName(..) const
    ParticleMass(..) const	  
    Double_t  ParticleCharge(..) const
    Double_t  ParticleLifeTime(..) const
    TMCParticleType ParticleMCType(..) const

    Examples:
    Update to changes in VMC:
    removed functions TrackingRmax, TrackingZmax (not needed if default is used);
    removed calls to gMC->DefineParticles() in InitMC 
    (this function is going to be removed from TVirtualMC).  
   
    Tested with Geant4 5.2, Root 3.10/01.

  21/07/2003:
  v1-0:
    Convertors:
    Added new directory with geometry convertors:
    - roottog4 - convertor from Root to G4 (still in development);
    - g4toxml - convertor from G4 to XML (AGDD) - separated from
                geant4_vmc

    Geant4_vmc:
    Updated for changes in TVirtualMCStack;
    modifications to support geometry defined via TGeo
    using roottog4 convertor.
    
    Examples:
    In E01 added new functions for building geometry via TGeo
    as an alternative to old way via VMC;
    update for changes in TVirtualStack.  
    
    Tested with Geant4 5.2, Root 3.05/06.

  03/06/2003:
  v0-5:
    geant4_vmc:
    Enabled a user defined physics list:
    TG4VRunConfiguration can be overriden by a user own
    class instantiating a user own physics list
    (derived from G4VUserPhysicsList). 
    Update for Geant4 5.1.

    Examples:
    Corrected deleting of MC application
    (to avoid warning from deleting static G4 objects when exiting Root)
    
    Tested with Geant4 5.1, Root 3.05/04.

  13/03/2003:
  v0-4:
    geant4_vmc:
    Saving secondary particles to MC stack made optional
    (added /mcTracking/saveSecondaries command); 
    a few corrections.
    
    Examples:
    New example E03;    
    Corrected implementation in the examples stack classes
    - fixed meaning of the argument done (renamed toBeDone)
    to be consistent with TGeant3 implementation;

    Tested with Geant4 5.0, Root 3.05/03.

  29/01/2003:
  v0-3:
    Update to changes in TVirtualMC;
    the XML convertor classes made independent from Geant4 VMC.
    Tested with Geant4 5.0, Root 3.05/00.

  18/12/2002:
  v0-2:
    Update for new Geant4 version; 
    a few corrections (mainly in makefiles).
    Tested with Geant4 5.0, Root 3.04/01.

  12/10/2002:  
  v0-1:
    The first released version;
    tested with Geant4 4.1 + patch01, Root 3.03/09.
     
  20/09/2002:   
  First revision:
    Implementation of TVirtualMC interface (in Root) for Geant4;
    source: AliRoot/TGeant4.
    See previous history in AliRoot/AliGeant4/doc/history.
