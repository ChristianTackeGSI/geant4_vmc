Geant4 VMC - Virtual MC implementation for Geant4
=================================================

Files:
------
  README   - this file
  source   - structured source code
  config   - general makefiles
  examples - examples of usage Virtual MC
	      
   
Environment:
------------
  Geant4 VMC requires Root, CLHEP and Geant4 installations.
  The paths to these installations are defined using the
  standard environment variables (ROOTSYS, G4INSTALL):

  ROOTSYS  - path to Root installation
  CLHEP_BASE_DIR - path to CLHEP installation		    
  G4INSTALL - path to the Geant4 installation
  G4*       - Geant4 environment variables used for selection
              graphics drivers and UIs have the same meaning as
              for Geant4; 
	      Use Configure script in Geant4 to set G4 environment.
              See Geant4 documentation for more details.
	      
	      Note: To build Geant4 shared libraries (required) 
	            G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED has to be set.
 
  It is important to install Geant4 VMC with the same environment
  setting as Geant4.

  The load paths to shared libraries for Root, CLHEP, Geant4, Geant4 VMC
  has to be added to the environment variable  
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH - on Linux, Solaris, SGI, Alpha/OSF;
  SHLIB_PATH - on HP-UX.
    
 
Compilation:
------------
  Geant4 VMC requires Root, CLHEP and Geant4 installation.
  Instructions for these installations can be found in their
  own documentation, they are not provided in this README. 

  cd geant4_vmc/source
  gmake

  Compilation targets:
  gmake      builds library
  includes   builds the directory geant4_vmc/include with all header files
  all        builds both library and includes
  clean      removes tmp, includes
  cleanall   removes lib, tmp, includes
  dist       creates tar file with distribution of source + binary files
  distsrc    creates tar file with distribution of source

  Note about G4 environment:
  By default, Geant4 VMC supports only the following
  graphics drivers: OpenGL (OGLIX, OGLSX, OGLSXm).
  In order to include other Geant4 graphics drivers or UIs in Geant4 VMC,
  you can replace the block starting ## Supported Geant4 VIS, UI ## comment line
  with uncommented block the  starting  with ## Full Geant4 VIS, UI ## comment
  line in the main Makefile (geant4_vmc/source/Makefile).
  Be aware that not all options were tested with Geant4 VMC 
  and even though a correct behaviour is expected, 
  it is not guaranteed.   

Examples
============
  To build examples libraries:
  cd geant4_vmc/examples
  gmake  

  To run examples:
  cd geant4_vmc/examples/E01
  root
  root [0] .x run_g3.C   // to run with Geant3
  root [0] .x run_g4.C   // to run with Geant4
  
  Note about Pythia6:
  Both MC require to load libPythia6.so which is not
  provided with Root by default. One can download it
  from the Root Web site:
  http://root.cern.ch/root/Install.html
  (Or directly from: ftp://root.cern.ch/root/pythia/)
  

Root and Geant4 UI
==================

   I. Switching UI
   
   When running Geant4 with Virtual MC a user can switch between
   Root UI and Geant4 UI:
   
   From Root to Geant4 UI:
   root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->StartGeantUI()                                            
   
   From Geant4 to Root UI:
   PreInit> /mcControl/root                                                         
   
   
   II. Calling macros
   
   Call Geant4 macro "myMacro.in" from Root:
   root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->ProcessGeantMacro("myMacro.in");

   Call Root macro "myMacro.C" from Geant4:
   PreInit> /mcControl/rootMacro myMacro
                                    
   
   III. Calling commands
   
   Call Geant4 command from Root:
   root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->ProcessGeantCommand("/tracking/verbose 1");
   
   Call Root command from Geant4:
   Idle> /mcControl/rootCmd TBrowser b;
